# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about StockPulse Data Pipeline.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Q: What is StockPulse?
**A:** StockPulse is an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for Indian stock market data. It automatically fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance, processes it, stores it in a database, and provides interactive visualizations through a web dashboard.

### Q: Which stocks are supported?
**A:** Currently supports:
- **RELIANCE.NS** (Reliance Industries)
- **TCS.NS** (Tata Consultancy Services)
- **INFY.NS** (Infosys Limited)

You can easily add more NSE/BSE stocks by modifying the ticker list in `scripts/pipeline.py`.

### Q: Is this free to use?
**A:** Yes! StockPulse is open-source and free. The only costs might be:
- Supabase database (free tier available)
- Cloud hosting if you deploy it (optional)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Questions

### Q: What programming language is used?
**A:** Python is the primary language, with these key libraries:
- **pandas** for data manipulation
- **streamlit** for the web dashboard
- **yfinance** for stock data
- **sqlalchemy** for database operations

### Q: Do I need a database?
**A:** Yes, but it's easy to set up:
- **Recommended**: Supabase (free PostgreSQL database)
- **Alternative**: Local PostgreSQL or MySQL
- **Fallback**: CSV files (limited functionality)

### Q: How often is data updated?
**A:** Data updates are manual by default. Run this command to refresh:
```bash
python scripts/pipeline.py
```

Future versions may include automated scheduling.

## üìä Data Questions

### Q: How much historical data is included?
**A:** By default, 60 days of historical data. You can modify this in `scripts/fetch_stocks.py`:
```python
def fetch_stock_data(ticker="RELIANCE.NS", days=60):  # Change this
```

### Q: What data points are collected?
**A:** For each trading day:
- **OHLCV**: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
- **Daily Returns**: Percentage change from previous day
- **SMA_20**: 20-day Simple Moving Average
- **Date**: Trading date

### Q: Is real-time data available?
**A:** Currently uses end-of-day data from Yahoo Finance. Real-time data would require:
- Paid data feeds
- Different architecture (streaming)
- More complex infrastructure

## üíª Setup Questions

### Q: I'm getting database connection errors. What should I do?
**A:** Check these common issues:
1. **Username format**: Use `postgres.your_project_ref` not just `postgres`
2. **Password**: Verify in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Database
3. **Host**: Use pooler host `aws-region.pooler.supabase.com`
4. **Port**: Use `6543` for pooler connection

See [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) for detailed solutions.

### Q: Can I run this without Supabase?
**A:** Yes, but with limitations:
- Dashboard will use CSV files instead of database
- Slower performance
- No real-time updates
- Limited scalability

### Q: What if I don't have Python experience?
**A:** StockPulse is designed to be beginner-friendly:
1. Follow the [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md) step-by-step
2. All commands are provided
3. Pre-configured settings work out-of-the-box
4. Extensive documentation and troubleshooting guides

- üü¢ **Buy**: Price above moving average + positive momentum
- üü° **Hold**: Price near moving average or mixed signals  
- üî¥ **Sell**: Price below moving average + negative momentum

**Important**: These are for learning only, not financial advice!

### Q: What do the technical indicators mean?
**A:** Key indicators explained:
- **SMA_20**: 20-day average price, shows trend direction
- **Daily Return**: Day-to-day percentage change

        "RELIANCE.NS", 
        "TCS.NS", 
        "INFY.NS",
        "HDFCBANK.NS",  # Add new stocks here
        "ICICIBANK.NS"
    ]
